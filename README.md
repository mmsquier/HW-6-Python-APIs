# HW-6-Python-APIs
Utilized API to extract Weather data to formulate an excel sheet with randomized cities and analyze how their latitude location was affecting certain weather/climate conditions. 

Latitude vs Temperature:

Latitudes closer to zero have a higher recorded temperature. The latitudes farther away from zero have cooler maximum temperature. This correlates with our expectations that cities and countries in far northern and southern hemispheres are closer to the poles and have cooler weather. 
 
Latitude vs Humidity: 

Humidity recordings along the latitudes is more uniformed but latitudes located closer to the equator have greater percentage of humidity. There are higher recordings of humidity in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere. This is a result of higher amount of tropical climate throughout the northern latitudes than in the southern latitudes. 

Latitudes vs Cloudiness: 

The measurement of cloudiness throughout the latitudes does not seem to be significant. A variation of  percentage of cloudiness is present in all latitudes. 

Latitude vs Wind Speed: 

The general wind speed recordings remain at or below 10 mph throughout the latitudes. There are higher wind recordings than 10 mph but it is also dispursed throughout the latitudes.
